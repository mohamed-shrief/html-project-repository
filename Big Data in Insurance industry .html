                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The insurance industry holds importance not only for individuals but also business companies. The reason insurance holds a significant place is because it supports people during times of adversities and uncertainties. The data collected from these sources are of varying formats and change at tremendous speeds.

                         <li>  <p>As big data refers to gathering data from disparate sources, this feature creates a crucial use case for the insurance industry to pounce on. Eg: When a customer intends to buy a car insurance kenya, the companies can obtain information from which they can calculate the safety levels for driving in the buyer’s vicinity and his past driving records. On basis of this they can effectively calculate cost of car insurance as well.
